# Trees-Classification-Project
Flatiron School - Phase 3 Classification project

Using data from NYC Opendata, create a machine-learning model to predict whether a tree is in need of care and/or replacement
Provide NYC Parks department with an optimized model to prioritize trees needing care, minimizing resources to fix and increase the canopy across the city


## Predictor Variables
Two sets of predictor variables were assessed - Life status (Dead/Stump vs alive) and "Problems" vs. no problems. Problems were classified whether any value (other than 'None') was input into the problems variable. 

## Predicting Life Status
When building the base model for Life Status, it was observed that the model had 100% accuracy. Upon further EDA of the predictor variables, it was clear that any tree classified as "Dead/Stump" had little further information on the tree plot - therefore, it was best to scrap this target variable, and build a new model. This model was kept as part of our Conclusions/Next steps, in order to further better the dataset.
